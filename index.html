            Overview
          </h2>
          <p>I am a dedicated software engineer, having more than a decade of experience in software design and development, with the passion for creating good programs and products. My biggest expertise is in C++, as well as Java/Python as secondary languages, separately or together. I supported legacy systems, implemented new systems, and designed them from scratch. I have experience both in enterprise and in startups, setting up development processes and workflows, Agile/Scrum, code review, Continuous Integration, and task tracking, and providing technical leadership to a small team of Software Engineers, DevOps and QA. You can take a look at my projects on Github, including but not limited to following software projects</p>

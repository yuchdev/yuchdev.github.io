            <h2 id="about-title">About</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Senior-to-Lead Software Engineer with almost two decades of hands-on experience
                designing, evolving, and maintaining complex software systems across industries and platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                My core expertise is <strong>C++</strong>, not as a niche or specialized tool, but as a
                <strong>general-purpose systems language</strong> - one that I have used across the entire stack,
                from low-level infrastructure to user-facing applications. Over the years, I have worked with C++
                in a wide range of contexts: kernel-adjacent and performance-critical components, cross-platform
                desktop applications, internal tooling, and large-scale enterprise systems handling financial risk
                and sensitive data.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am deeply familiar with modern C++ (up to C++20) and have extensive experience modernizing
                long-lived codebases - some with more than twenty years of production history. This work is less
                about chasing new language features and more about introducing safer abstractions, improving
                performance, and reducing technical debt <strong>without breaking systems that people depend on</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I approach software with a strong <strong>cross-platform mindset</strong>. I have worked
                extensively on Linux, macOS, and Windows, combining portable C++ with deep platform integration
                where necessary - POSIX, WinAPI, and system-level tooling. For me, portability is never accidental;
                it is engineered deliberately, tested continuously, and maintained consciously.
            </p>

            <h3>Java - systems designed to outlive trends</h3>
            <p>
                Alongside C++, I have strong experience with <strong>Java</strong> in long-living enterprise systems,
                where correctness, backward compatibility, and predictability matter more than novelty.
            </p>
            <p>My Java work has focused on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Core backend services and integration layers</li>
                <li>Performance-sensitive components within large platforms</li>
                <li>Long-term system evolution without disruptive rewrites</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I value Java for its ability to support <strong>incremental change</strong> in large systems - allowing
                architecture to evolve while production remains stable.
            </p>

            <h3>Python - a first-class engineering language</h3>
            <p>
                I use <strong>Python</strong> not as a scripting afterthought, but as a <strong>full-fledged engineering tool</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Over the years, I have used Python to build:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Backend services (Django, Flask)</li>
                <li>Data processing pipelines (Pandas, Dask)</li>
                <li>Automation, testing, and QA infrastructure (Pytest, Hypothesis)</li>
                <li>Desktop applications (PyQt)</li>
                <li>Internal developer tooling and CI utilities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Python allows me to turn complex ideas into working systems quickly - without sacrificing structure,
                readability, or long-term maintainability.
            </p>

            <h3>Making languages work together</h3>
            <p>
                A recurring theme in my work is <strong>bridging languages and ecosystems</strong> rather than treating
                them as isolated worlds.
            </p>
            <p>I have designed and maintained systems where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C++ and Java coexist in large enterprise platforms</li>
                <li>
                    Python and C++ interact in both directions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clean, stable Python APIs over high-performance C++ cores</li>
                        <li>Native C++ libraries loaded into Python/Django environments for compute-heavy workloads</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This approach allows me to combine <strong>Python's agility</strong> with <strong>C++'s raw performance</strong>,
                without losing clarity, debuggability, or operational stability.
            </p>

            <h3>Beyond code: delivery, infrastructure, and production</h3>
            <p>
                I do not stop at writing code - I make sure it <strong>builds, ships, runs, and survives</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>My experience includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing and maintaining complex CI/CD pipelines</li>
                <li>DevOps automation and AWS-based infrastructure</li>
                <li>Working comfortably at the boundary between development and production systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I find this intersection - where code meets real users, real data, and real constraints - both challenging
                and genuinely rewarding.
            </p>

            <h3>How I work</h3>
            <p>What defines my engineering approach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Systems designed to last for decades, not demos</li>
                <li>A balance of performance, safety, and clarity</li>
                <li>Pragmatic engineering over dogma</li>
                <li>Respect for legacy systems - and the discipline to improve them carefully</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I build software people trust with their <strong>money, data, and time</strong> - and I build it to endure.
            </p>

            <h3>Beyond engineering: long-form thinking and personal projects</h3>
            <p>
                Alongside my professional work, I maintain long-running personal projects that reflect how I think about
                systems beyond code.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of them is writing and translating books, which I treat much like software projects: long-term structure,
                internal consistency, versioning, and iterative refinement. Working with complex texts - especially translations - 
                sharpens the same skills I rely on in engineering: precision, respect for existing structure, and the ability
                to improve clarity without distorting meaning. It is slow, deliberate work, and I find it deeply rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also interested in time-management and self-organization techniques, particularly those that support sustained
                focus over long periods rather than short bursts of productivity. This interest naturally feeds back into my
                engineering work - from how I structure large tasks and technical debt reduction, to how I plan learning,
                documentation, and system evolution over years rather than sprints.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see these pursuits not as hobbies separate from my profession, but as complementary practices that reinforce the
                same core values: clarity, continuity, and respect for complexity.
            </p>

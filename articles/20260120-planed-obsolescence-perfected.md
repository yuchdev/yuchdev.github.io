# Planed Obsolescence: Perfected

My opinion on Apple is quite unorthodox. I've been a user of Apple laptops for more than a decade, and I genuinely consider them a pinnacle of UX engineering. But when it comes to the smartphone, I increasingly see it not as a tool - but as a token of participation.

There's a quiet brilliance to Apple's marketing that only becomes obvious when you stop looking at keynote slides and start looking at pockets.

Once upon a time, the iPhone was a luxury object. A polished slab of future that clearly marked social stratification: this person paid for comfort, aesthetics, and a bit of technological magic.

Today, that symbolism has inverted.

The iPhone is no longer a marker of abundance - it is a marker of participation.

Owning one doesn't signal wealth. It signals compliance with a cultural operating system. Blue bubbles. AirDrop. iMessage groups. FaceTime. Shared notes. Shared calendars. Shared ecosystem gravity.

Not having one doesn't mean you lack money. It means you've opted out of the protocol.

And here's where it gets interesting.

Apple has perfected something no hardware company managed at this scale before: planned obsolescence disguised as continuity.

On paper, devices receive updates for years. In practice, each iteration quietly increases baseline resource demands, nudges battery degradation into "noticeable inconvenience," and introduces features that subtly depend on newer silicon. Nothing dramatic. Nothing scandalous. Just enough friction to make upgrading feel rational.

It's not forced. It's induced.

You don't replace your phone because it died.
You replace it because it feels slightly behind the social tempo.

And then comes the psychological masterpiece: ecosystem copium.

We've all heard it.

"8 GB on a MacBook Pro is like 16 GB on a PC."
"It's optimized."
"macOS handles memory differently."

Optimization exists, of course. But physics still exists too.

When a MacBook Pro ships with 8 GB of RAM in 2024 and people defend it as "professional grade," you're no longer observing technical evaluation - you're observing belief alignment. When a flagship iPhone ships with RAM figures that Android mid-range devices surpassed years ago, and the conversation shifts to "it just works," that's narrative power at work.

Apple doesn't sell specs.
They sell absolution from thinking about specs.

That strategy works brilliantly on laptops, because the integration between hardware and macOS genuinely delivers coherence. The UX polish is real. The battery life on Apple Silicon is real. The build quality is real.

But on smartphones, something changed.

The iPhone no longer feels like the cutting edge of personal computing. It feels like the entry ticket to a gated community. A device whose primary function is to maintain compatibility with a social mesh.

And here's the paradox: Apple is strongest precisely because most users do not evaluate devices as tools - they evaluate them as symbols.

The modern iPhone is not a luxury watch.
It's more like a passport stamp.

It says: I belong to this ecosystem.

And Apple has mastered the art of making sure that belonging feels safer than leaving.

That is not accidental.
That is architecture.

Congratulations, we Optimized Away the Future!

Five years ago, giving a tedious task to a Junior Developer wasn't charity - it was strategy. Writing unit tests for legacy code. Refactoring a crusty module. Converting schemas. Cleaning up edge cases. It was boring work for Seniors, but it was formative work for Juniors. That's how they learned how systems break - and how to fix them.

The "boring but formative" tasks quietly moved from "give it to a Junior Dev" to "give it to Copilot/Claude," and everyone celebrates the throughput - while the natural technical experience ladder rots.

It's faster. It's cheaper. It's often syntactically flawless. And that efficiency is quietly dismantling the apprenticeship model our industry was built on.

In my company, I barely see Junior hiring anymore. Maybe it still happens somewhere, but the visible pipeline has thinned dramatically. The "bottom rung" is disappearing - not because we hate Juniors, but because AI handles the tasks we once used to train them.

And here's the uncomfortable truth: if we remove the grunt work, we remove the growth path.

"Even if the industry is writing juniors off, I'd rather engineer a fix than accept the loss."

Because this isn't some sentimental considerations. It's risk management. A Senior Developer isn't produced by reading documentation or prompting an LLM. A Senior Developer is forged by touching fragile systems, breaking things, debugging production incidents, and slowly building a mental model of how software actually behaves under stress.

If we automate away that exposure entirely, where do future Seniors come from?

That's not a philosophical question. It's a structural one.

So instead of debating whether AI replaces Juniors pronounce their roles outright dead, I think we need to redesign what "Junior" means in an AI-first environment.

In the following article, I propose to consider practical ways to redesign the Junior role in an AI-first team - from agentic guardrails to AI documentation auditing.

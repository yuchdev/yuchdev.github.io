If a developer has a serious portfolio - and you ignore it - that's a red flag.

I have 54 public repositories.

6 curated as portfolio projects.

Multithreaded data structures, architecture docs, CI, benchmarks.

Hundreds of hours invested.

During one hiring process (while working full-time and parenting a newborn), I passed interviews - only to be asked, at the final stage, to implement a non-trivial lock-free assignment. Portfolio examples weren't considered "sufficient."

I've also spent numerous times on 8–16 hours take-home assignments like high-performance web-server and got ghosted.

A portfolio isn't decoration. It's evidence.

If it's not even reviewed, the problem may not be the candidate.

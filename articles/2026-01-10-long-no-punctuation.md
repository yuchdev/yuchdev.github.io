title: Long Text Without Punctuation Test

This is a very long paragraph that exceeds 300 characters but contains almost no punctuation after the 300 character threshold so the algorithm should perform a hard cut at exactly 300 characters and append an ellipsis because no sentence boundary can be found within a reasonable distance from the cutoff point and we need to ensure truncation happens properly

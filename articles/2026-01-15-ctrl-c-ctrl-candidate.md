# Ctrl-C (Ctrl-Candidate)

Another episode in my collection of "alternative-reality interviews"

I was invited to interview for a C++/Qt position. The interviewer insisted on keeping the camera on. Fair enough - I actually enjoy live technical dialogue. We moved from basic questions to deeper ones, even conversation seemed oddly onesided and mechanical. While discussing class design, I mentioned Qt's signal/slot mechanism is the closest practical implementation to what Dijkstra envisioned as disciplined OOP abstractions - and tried to steer the conversation into more meaningful territory, still answering everything precisely.

The interviewer smiled and said:

"Sorry, I'm not a technical person. I was just given a list of questions and answers."

At that moment, the mandatory video suddenly made perfect sense. It wasn't about discussion - it was about surveillance. Making sure the candidate doesn't have Mark Sommerfeld's book on his knees like we did in college exams.

I withdrew my candidacy from consideration.

It's hard to invent a more faceless, tasteless, unimaginative, and frankly disrespectful way to treat a senior candidate. On that background, even a well-designed online test or take-home assignment feels more honest - even in the age of AI, where framing evaluation properly is its own challenge.

This format sends a simple message:

"We value your time less than ours. And we value your expertise even less."

This is a very long first paragraph that exceeds 300 characters and contains proper sentence boundaries after that threshold. The preview extraction algorithm should identify the first sentence boundary after 300 characters and cut there. For example, this sentence right here ends with a period. And this is another sentence that follows. The algorithm should find the boundary correctly and append an ellipsis to indicate truncation.

                Overview
            </h2>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated software engineer, having more than a decade of experience in software design and
                development, with the passion for creating good programs and products. My biggest expertise is in C++,
                as well as Java/Python as secondary languages, separately or together. I supported legacy systems,
                implemented new systems, and designed them from scratch. I have experience both in enterprise and in
                startups, setting up development processes and workflows, Agile/Scrum, code review, Continuous
                Integration, and task tracking, and providing technical leadership to a small team of Software
                Engineers, DevOps and QA. You can take a look at my projects on Github, including but not limited to
                the following software projects

                                This role marked the beginning of my professional software engineering career. From the
                                outset, I aimed to gain exposure to as many aspects of the development process as
                                possible while participating in the full software lifecycle, from design analysis and
                                implementation to testing and release.

                                Worked within a mature security product environment, contributing to both user-facing
                                and low-level components. Gained foundational experience in C++, cross-platform
                                development, legacy code maintenance, debugging, and refactoring, while learning to
                                operate within large, multi-module codebases typical of long-lived security products.

                                        transitioned to backend and infrastructure modules, including a C++ SQLite-based
